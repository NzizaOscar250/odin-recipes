    <h1>Crispy Hash</h1>
    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better,.<br> then you've come to the right place. 
        Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.<br></p>
    <p>Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision,<br>
             but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, <br>
             then you should try this hash brown recipe. 
             The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash<br>
             browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair 
             deliciously with any breakfast dish.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.</p>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</p>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</p>
    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.    </p>
    <h5>Step 6</h5>
    Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
    <h5>Step 7</h5>
    <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
